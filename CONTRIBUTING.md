## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Renamed parameter mesh_Volume to mesh_volume in mesh_handling.

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Renamed parameter mesh_Volume to mesh_volume in mesh_handling, to 
> follow naming structure of the mesh_handling module.

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - There are no bugs
  - Good parameter, method and class names which explain what things are.
  - Docstrings and comments where needed for understanding.
  - Parameter names fit with conventions otherwise used in the document

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

  - To provide a tool for parametric generation of representative 
  fast-ferry hull shapes, for analysis and optimization of vessels.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will
remove things that do not respect it.
